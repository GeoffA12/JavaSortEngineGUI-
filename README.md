# SortEngineGUI-

This repository contains the final assignment I programmed in my Introductory Computer Science course in Java. This program contains a Java Sort Engine GUI implementation. This sort engine acts as a visual representation or timeline of how different sorting algorithms process and sort through quantities of data. The visual component of the program consists of a bar graph in which each narrow column represents an array of integers which is unsorted. Once the user presses the "Start" button on the frame, each narrow column on the view will update according to the sorting algorithm which is selected in the dropdown menu. 

Several core principles were of main focus in this project. One of the most significant concepts I learned after completing this project would be the MVC relationship. As you can see from this repository, the SortEngineImpl.java, SortView.java, and SortFrame.java were all heavily studied and developed from inception to completion. 

To run the interface, fork this repo and clone it to your system. After you have the files stored on your computer, run the SortFrame.java file.
